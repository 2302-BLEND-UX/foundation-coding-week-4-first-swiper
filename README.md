## Basic swiper, and pokemon card swiper

- Intro to swiper.js (https://swiperjs.com/)
- Docs (https://swiperjs.com/swiper-api)
- We have used swiper on two pages here to set up sliders
- If you use multiple swipers on pages, you may need to add a new script file for each one, unless both swipers are on the same page
